# Coinflip

- Pass this challenge by correctly guessing the outcome of the coinflip 10 times in a row

# Hints

- CoinFlip's flip function is _intended_ to randomly make the side variable either true or false
- Can you create similar logic in your attacking contract to correctly choose what the flip function will choose?
- You may add code on `AttackingCoinFlip`.sol and/or `CoinFlipHelper.ts` to help pass the tests in CoinFlip.test.ts
